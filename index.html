A characteristic feature of living systems is the ability to adapt based on limited feedback. However, from single cells to animal collectives, living systems operate well beyond the regime where traditional optimization principles apply, that is, sensory input and control output are often high-dimensional. An animal cannot hope to learn a control strategy from scratch by exploring a high-dimensional control space within its lifetime. For example, a simple grasping movement involves more than 20 degrees of freedom; learning this movement through trial-and-error would require finding a specific trajectory from point A to point B in a 20-dimensional state space with unknown constraints and nonlinear dynamics.
Of course, appropriate mechanisms to lower the dimensionality of the search space ultimately make it possible to learn from a few trials. A few examples of such mechanisms include exploiting conserved structure in the environment, ‘shaping’ the trajectory through a curriculum, learning through imitation and through innately encoded prior knowledge. Animals are known to use various such mechanisms and machine learning models can be designed to capture some of this behavior. However, we lack a principled understanding of how these mechanisms effectively constrain the dimen- sionality of states and controls to enable rapid learning. Identifying these basic prin- ciples will help uncover how they are implemented in living systems and inspire the development of artificial systems that learn quickly.
